# Midwest:Shortest-Path
#Overview
I have created a program that searches for the shortest distance travel between two States Capitals in the Midwest by 
implementing the A* search algorithm.

#Instruction
User must type a starting location in the midwest and an ending location.
Then the algorithm takes care of the rest.
User input is case sensitive: for example it will only read, "Springfield, Illinois" but not sprintfield, illinois or any other version.
