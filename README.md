# Midwest:Shortest-Path
#Overview
I have created a program that searches for the shortest distance travel between two States Capitals in the Midwest by 
implementing the A* search algorithm.

#What's the A* search algorithm ?
The A* Search Algorithm is an Artificial Intelligence algorithm that is used to find the shortest possible path from a start to end state. It uses path cost(distance from one point to another ) plus the heuristic( the path distance on a straight line).

#Instruction
User must type a starting location in the midwest and an ending location.
Then the algorithm takes care of the rest.
User input is case sensitive: for example it will only read, "Springfield, Illinois" but not "springfield, illinois" or any other variation.
